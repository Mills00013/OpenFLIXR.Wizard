# OpenFLIXR Media Server
OpenFLIXR Media Server (OpenFLIXR in short) is an all-in-one media server for downloading and serving virtually any kind of media you can think of. On the one side we have incredible useful tools to download media like CouchPotato, SickRage and Headphones, on the other side we have Plex Media Server to bring everything to your screens. Be it tablets, TVs, PCs, you name it. Everything is web based, including monitoring and management tools.

It will auto-update to keep everything running smooth and is preconfigured with sensible defaults. To be able to use OpenFLIXR, you’ll need a hypervisor like VirtualBox (Open Source), VMWare Fusion / Workstation / Player / ESXi, Parallels Desktop, KVM / unRAID or Microsoft Hyper-V.
